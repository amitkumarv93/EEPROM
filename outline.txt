1. First I will try to read and write the data through Tx/Rx FIFO of LoRA which is 256 bytes of memory. I will write the data to SPI bus and EEPROM will be used to store the data to the cloud. 

Different modes used for LoRA:
1. Sleep: SPI and configuration registers accessible. FIFO is not accesible.
2. STANDBY: PLL disabled
3. TX: Powers up all the blocks to transmit, ramps the PA, transmits the packet and enters standby.
4. RX: Powers up all the blocks to receive, remains in this state until a valid packet has been received and then returns to Standby mode.
5. RX continuous: Powers up all the blocks to receive, processing all received data until a new user request is made to change operating mode.

2. I will try to send and receive student data from UART1. I will add data to EEPROM. I will read data from LORA and transmit 0 or 1 for fail or success.

3. Delete students from PC. 

4. Success/Fail 

5. Add students to csv

6. Success/Fail

7. Finally I will try to convert the data received from RS 232(UART) to USB by using FT232RL interface. Commands will go from Calculator to PC. 

8. Then commands will go from PC to calculator. Download the CSV file.
